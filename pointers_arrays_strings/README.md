0x06. C - Arrays, Pointers and Strings

Description

This project aims to deepen my understanding of C arrays, pointers, and strings, as well as how memory is laid out in a C program. You will implement functions that manipulate arraysand strings without using the standard library (except for _putchar), and demonstrate mastery of pointer arithmetic and variable scope.
